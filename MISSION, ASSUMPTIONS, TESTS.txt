MISSION
- Squad of rovers are to be landed on a Mars Plateau (3 rovers)
- The rovers navigate the plateau and return their camera footage
- Rover position is dictated by their grid position followed by the direction they're facing (x, y, N/S/E/W)
    - Bottom Left corner = (0, 0, N)
- To control a rover, a string of letters is sent to the rover
    - These are: 'L' (trun 90 degrees left), 'R' (turn 90 degrees right), 'M' (move forward one grip point)

- Input:
    - The first line of input is the coordinates for the top right corner of the grid
    - The subsequent lines of input pertain to the rovers:
        - Each rover gets 2 lines of input:
            - The first line gives the rover's position
                - The position is made up of two integers and a letter for the rover's direction, separated by spaces
            - The second line is a series of instructions on how to explore the plateau

- Each rover must finish moving before the next rover can move

- Output:
    - the output should be the rover's final positioning and its heading

- Test:
    - 5 5
    - 1 2 N 
    - LMLMLMLMM
- Output:
    - 1 3 N 


ASSUMPTIONS
- user can read and understand english instructions/error messages
- plateau must be rectangular
- rovers must not go out of the plateau area
- rovers ending in the same point/crossing points with another rover does not imply collision
- user may input any amount of whitespace on either side of an input string
- user only uses rovers once and not again
- rovers can start from the same position
